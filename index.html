    <h1>Prince's Career</h1>
    <div>
    <p>Prince was born Prince Rogers Nelson on June 7, 1958, in Minneapolis, 
        Minnesota. His early music career saw the release of Prince, 
        Dirty Mind and Controversy, which drew attention for their fusion 
        of religious and sexual themes. He then released the popular albums 
        1999 and Purple Rain, cementing his superstar status with No. 1 hits
         like "When Doves Cry" and "Let's Go Crazy." A seven-time Grammy winner,
        Prince had a prodigious output that included later albums like Diamonds
         and Pearls, The Gold Experience and Musicology. He died on April 21, 2016,
          from an accidental drug overdose.</p>
